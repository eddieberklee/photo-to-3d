# Assumptions

## Technical
1. TripoSR on Replicate is the best balance of quality/speed/cost for MVP
2. GLB format works for both web viewing and 3D printing
3. No auth needed for MVP - anonymous uploads acceptable
4. Supabase free tier sufficient for testing
5. Replicate pricing (~$0.01-0.05 per generation) acceptable for MVP

## User Experience
1. Users will upload single objects, not scenes
2. Mobile users are a primary audience
3. 60-90 second wait time is acceptable
4. Users want to download the model, not just view

## Business
1. This is an MVP/experiment, not production
2. No monetization in v1
3. Usage will be low during testing

## Out of Scope
1. User accounts
2. Gallery of previous generations
3. Model editing/refinement
4. Direct 3D printer integration
5. Multi-image input for better quality
